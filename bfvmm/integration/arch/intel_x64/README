Extended APIs integration testing

Integration tests work by running the VMM with various extended API features
enabled and/or disabled.

Building
--------
The test_all.sh script requires three arguments:

    1. The path to the cmake build directory
    2. The path to the hypervisor source directory
    3. The path to a cmake config file

The config must be set to build the extended APIs with the NDEBUG
flag NOT defined in the CXX flags. The script will build the eapis
integration test VMMs, build and load bfdriver, and run the VMMs in sequence.

Adding new tests
----------------
To add a new integration test:

1. Add a target for the test in the eapis top-level CMakeLists.txt
2. Add a regular expression that uniquely identifies the test binaries
   to the switch statement in 'check_test()' in test_all.sh. Then create
   a check_<test> function that is called when a match occurs. The
   check_<test> should contain verification code specific to the test(s)
   being added.
3. (Optional) Add a regex similar to the one in 2 above to the switch
   statement in init_test if your test requires pre-test initialization.
